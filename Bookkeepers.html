The evil witch, Luciana, is six glorious feet under, St. Ailbe's is closed due to human trespassers, and people are finally getting used to the fact that supernaturals exist in the world. It seems like the perfect time for a honeymoon.

                                “You hated the Shadow Market in London,” Kit said. “It really bothered you. The noises, and the crowd —“
<br>
                                Ty’s gaze flicked down to Kit. “I’ll wear my headphones. I’ll be all right.”

                                “…and I don’t know if we should go again so soon,” Kit added. “What if Helen and Aline get suspicious?”

                                Ty’s gaze darkened. “Julian told me once,” he said, “that when people keep coming up with reasons not do something, it’s because they don’t want to do it. Do you not want to do this?”
 <br>                               
                                Ty’s voice sounded tight. The thrumming wire again, sharp with tension. Under the cotton of his shirt, his too-thin shoulders had tightened as well. The neck of his shirt was loose, the delicate line of his collarbones just visible.
 <br>                               
                                Kit felt a rush of tenderness toward Ty, mixed with near-panic. In other circumstances, he thought, he would just have lied. But he couldn’t lie to Ty.”
